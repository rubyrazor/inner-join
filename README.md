# Inner Join.

Inne join. is a social network where users can register, make friends and chat with each other. I built the network in an intense three-week project at SPICED academy which I attended from Sept 2021 to Dec 2021.

## Features
The social network allows users to

- register and log in,
- create and alter a persoal profile,
- view the profiles of other users,
- befriend other users,
- chat with user users,
- find other other users through a username search.

## Stack

### Client & Server
The client-side is built as a sigle-page application with _React_. I use _Redux_ to manage the application's state information and _Webpack_ to compile the code. The _socket.io_ library which enables real-time, two-way communication between clients and servers is the basis for a smooth and instantaneous chat experience. 
The server-side is built with _Express_ which runs in a _Node_ environment. I use _AWS S3_ as a reliable, centralised and permanent storage solution for users' profile pics. _Uid-safe_ allows me to generate unique pic names before uploading. Other user information is stored in a local database managed with _PostgreSQL_. This database is populated with 200+ fake users.

### Security
Key security measures are put in place. The _bcrypt_ library allows for [salted password hashing](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm#normalhashing) and validation of user input. I use _AWS SES_ to authenticate users in case they forgot their passwords. Users are send a random single-use verification code generated with _crypto-random-string_ via email that expires after 15 min. To prevent SQL-injection attacks I employ the _node-postgres-module_ to escape user input. Denial-of-Service attacks are averted by setting an upload-limit of 2MB for profile pics.

### Testing
The application provides end-to-end (E2E) and unit testing. I use _Cypress_ to build an E2E test mocking all aspects of a real user interaction with the application. To ensure that changes to the code don't break any of the existing functionality, I use the _husky_ library to implement git hooks, thus ensuring that the E2E test runs every time new code is pushed to GitHub. In addition I provide unit tests written with _Jest_ for key components  of the application.
