# Inner Join.

This social network is a single page application.

I built the **client side** with _React_. I use _Redux_ to manage global state and _Webpack_ to compile the code. To view the application users have to register or log in.

Once logged in, users can update their profile, search for new friends and chat with each other. Users can also make and accept friend requests, as well as unfriend users.

I built the **server side** with _Express_ which runs in a _Node_ environment. I use _Express-Router_ to better structure client request handling. The database is managed with _PostgreSQL_. I use _Bcrypt_ on the server-side for [salted password hashing](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm#normalhashing) and authentication of user input.
